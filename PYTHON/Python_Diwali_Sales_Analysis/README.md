# 🎆 Diwali Sales Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **Diwali sales data** using Python to uncover customer purchasing patterns, high-performing product categories, and revenue-driving customer segments.

The objective of the project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on festive sales data and generate **business-oriented insights** that can help improve marketing strategies, customer targeting, and sales performance.
