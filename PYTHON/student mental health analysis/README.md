# 🧠 Student Mental Health Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **student mental health data** using Python to understand patterns related to **stress, anxiety, depression, academic pressure, and lifestyle factors**.

The objective of the project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and extract **meaningful insights** that can help educators, institutions, and policymakers better understand the mental well-being of students.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains survey-based information collected from students related to their mental health and academic life.  
Each record represents a student and includes attributes such as:

- Demographic details (age, gender, academic level)
- Academic pressure and workload
- Stress, anxiety, and depression indicators
- Sleep patterns and lifestyle factors
- Social and emotional well-being indicators

The dataset is structured and suitable for statistical and behavioral analysis.

## Business / Research Problem

Mental health issues among students are increasing due to academic pressure, lifestyle changes, and social factors.  
Institutions need data-driven insights to:

- Identify high-risk student groups
- Understand contributing factors to mental stress
- Support early intervention strategies
- Improve student well-being and academic outcomes

This project addresses these challenges through data analysis.

## Analysis Performed

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Standardized column names
- Converted data types for analysis

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Mental Health Indicators

- Analysis of stress, anxiety, and depression levels
- Comparison across different student groups
- Identification of common mental health patterns

**Insight:**  
Certain student groups report higher stress and anxiety levels.

---

#### Academic & Lifestyle Factors

- Relationship between academic pressure and mental health
- Impact of sleep duration on stress levels
- Analysis of workload and study hours

**Insight:**  
Higher academic pressure and poor sleep patterns are strongly associated with mental health issues.

---

#### Demographic Analysis

- Mental health trends by gender and age group
- Comparison across academic levels

**Insight:**  
Mental health experiences vary significantly across demographics.

---

## Key Insights

- Academic pressure is a major contributor to stress and anxiety
- Students with poor sleep habits show higher mental health risks
- Certain demographic groups are more vulnerable
- Lifestyle factors play a critical role in mental well-being

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment

---

## Use Case

This project represents a real-world **educational and social analytics use case**, useful for:

- Educational institutions
- Student counseling departments
- Mental health research
- Policy planning and awareness programs

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze student mental health data and convert survey responses into **actionable insights**.
