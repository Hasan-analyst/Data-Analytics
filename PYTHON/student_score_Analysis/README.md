# 🎓 Student Score Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **student academic performance data** using Python to understand how different factors influence student scores.  
The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between **study habits, demographic factors, and academic outcomes**.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains academic records of students along with related attributes.  
Each record represents a student and includes information such as:

- Student demographics (gender, age or related attributes)
- Study-related factors (study hours, preparation level, etc.)
- Academic scores (math, reading, writing or overall score)
- Additional background factors that may affect performance

The dataset is structured and suitable for statistical and performance analysis.

---

## Business / Academic Problem

Educational institutions need to understand:

- What factors influence student performance
- How study habits impact scores
- Performance differences across student groups
- Areas where students may need academic support

This project uses data analysis to answer these questions.

---

## Analysis Performed

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing or inconsistent values
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Converted data types for analysis
- Removed irrelevant columns if required

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Score Distribution Analysis

- Analyzed the distribution of student scores
- Identified high-performing and low-performing ranges

**Insight:**  
Student scores are not evenly distributed and show clear performance clusters.

---

#### Study Habits vs Performance

- Analyzed relationship between study time/preparation and scores
- Compared average scores across different study levels

**Insight:**  
Students with better study habits generally achieve higher scores.

---

#### Demographic Analysis

- Compared performance across gender or other demographic factors
- Identified score variation between different student groups

**Insight:**  
Performance trends vary across demographic segments.

---

#### Subject-wise Performance

- Compared scores across different subjects
- Identified subjects where students perform better or worse

**Insight:**  
Certain subjects consistently show higher or lower average scores.

---

## Key Insights

- Study habits have a strong impact on student performance
- Academic scores vary across different student groups
- Some subjects require more focused academic support
- Early identification of low-performing students can improve outcomes

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment

---

## Use Case

This project represents a real-world **educational analytics use case**, useful for:

- Academic performance evaluation
- Student progress tracking
- Educational research
- Data-driven academic planning

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze student score data and transform academic records into **actionable insights**.
