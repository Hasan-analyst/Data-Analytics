# Excel Data Analysis and Automation Project

## Project Description

This project is an Excel-based **data analysis and automation workflow** designed to process raw tabular data and convert it into **clean, structured, and analysis-ready information**.

The Excel file contains automated steps for **data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis**, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. The project reflects common tasks performed by a **Data Analyst / Business Analyst at an entry level**.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of structured records containing multiple attributes related to business/operational data.

The raw data includes:

- Categorical fields (such as types, categories, or labels)
- Numerical fields used for calculations and summaries
- Records that require cleaning, formatting, and validation before analysis

---

## Data Issues Addressed

The raw dataset initially contained:

- Inconsistent formatting
- Blank or missing values
- Duplicate records
- Unstructured columns not suitable for analysis

These issues were resolved using Excel automation techniques.

---

## Data Cleaning Process

The following data cleaning operations were performed:

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and blank values
- Standardized column formats
- Corrected inconsistent data types
- Renamed columns for clarity and readability
- Ensured numerical fields were ready for calculations

Power Query was used to make the cleaning process **repeatable and refreshable**.

---

## Data Transformation

After cleaning, the data was transformed to support analysis:

- Created calculated columns where required
- Filtered unnecessary records
- Structured the data into an analysis-ready table
- Applied consistent formatting rules
- Ensured the dataset can be refreshed with new data

All transformations are automated and reapply when the data is refreshed.

---

## Automation Features

The Excel file includes automation features such as:

- Power Query–based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Automated refresh of cleaned data
- Formula-driven calculations
- Minimal manual intervention after setup

This ensures faster processing and reduced chances of human error.

---

## Analysis Performed

The processed data supports:

- Summary-level analysis
- Trend identification
- Category-wise aggregation
- Basic performance or distribution insights

The output can be directly used for:

- Reporting
- Dashboards
- Further analysis in Power BI or Tableau

---

## Project Workflow

1. Load raw data into Excel
2. Power Query cleans and transforms the dataset
3. Cleaned data is stored in a structured format
4. Calculations and summaries are applied
5. Final output is ready for reporting or visualization

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query (M Language)
- Excel Formulas and Functions
